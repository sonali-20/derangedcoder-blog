This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

So it is 2020 and because of this pandemic my whole schedule was effed up and I was spending more that 8 hours on my phone which was clearly not good for my eyes and because of which I was just procastinating all the things.
It felt as I was loosing control of my life , so I planned to take social media off in June month #socialmediadetox just to have bit control on my lifestyle.The rules were simple, no social media on all devices for 30 days. No posting, no trolling, nothing.I started at the end of the month so it was easy to keep track of the days.
Removed all social media outlets from my phone and laptop: Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and Facebook. I didn't delete my accounts, I just took them off my phone. Though was using Whatsapp and Slack.
Scientists say the same neurotransmitters (dopamine) trigger in your brain when you get a hit of likes as you would a hit of cocaine. It was a high that I was consistently seeking.
All notifications were turned off. All apps were removed. And I felt an immediate feeling of freedom living without social media.
Day 1: I woke up at 9 in the morning though last night I thought I will be waking up early and started my day on a positive note though without insta I felt a bit of void that something is missing.
Day 2: It was second day without social media . Again I thought I will start a day fresh… Wake up early, exercise and then start my day. But how can this happen to me this sudden with my sleeping schedule fucked up.
So I woke up at 9 am, but today instead of directly starting off working, I first warmed up , did 2 sets of Surya Namaskar, 30 crunches and then I did 10 mins dance workout. It was almost 30 mins of workout. After that I sorted out my todo list what all is to be done.
Logged on for work at 10:00 am , prepared lunch by 12 and had it by 1. Started working again and day went smooth.
Developing a new habit or replacing an old one is not an easy thing to do. After all, it is a process of change. Humans are innately resistant to change.
Now with going days my screen time before bed reduced by practically half as I had habbit of scrolling through feeds in night.
But what happened next felt like a miracle. I got bored of having nothing to fill up my free time that I actually replaced my screen time with reading time.

I've learned there's usually nothing more important on your phone than what is sitting directly in front of you.
Increased time: As mentioned before, I've cut my screen time in half, and sometimes even less. I range around 2.5 hours a day on my phone now, compared to the 5 from my baseline. 2.5 X's 7 days a week is 17.5 hours a week that I have freed up for different tasks; which leads me to the next outcome.
Healthier Habits: The detox gave me an absurd amount of mental clarity that freed me to focus on things I wanted to do more of, but didn't know why I wasn't doing it. I started to reading more, working out more, meditating more. My sleep habits even improved because I wasn't staring at a bright screen right before bed.
Moving forward, once a year is my rule of thumb. I also suggest picking a month with holidays that annoys the hell out of you.
If you're not ready to commit, try it for a day and notice your subconscious impulses to check your phone. Eventually, ask yourself if you really are in control of how you're using social media. Or is it using you?
If you want to fly, you've got to give up the shit that weighs you down. - Toni Morrison
